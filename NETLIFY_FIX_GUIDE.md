# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Fix Guide

Your app isn't loading on Netlify because of missing environment variables and some configuration issues. Here's how to fix it:

## 🔧 Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Netlify

1. **Go to your Netlify dashboard**: https://app.netlify.com/
2. **Select your deployed site** (Pithu-ChatBot)
3. **Go to Site settings** → **Environment variables**
4. **Add these variables**:

```
VITE_GEMINI_API_URL = https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY = AIzaSyA6yHe70GjZOAZfm6Ctvs6iTCQTK0qGBKI
```

## 🔄 Step 2: Redeploy Your Site

After adding the environment variables:

1. **Go to Deploys** tab in your Netlify dashboard
2. **Click "Trigger deploy"** → **"Deploy site"**
3. **Wait for the build to complete**

## 🌐 Step 3: Alternative - Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

If the above doesn't work, try this:

1. **Push your latest changes to GitHub** (we'll do this below)
2. **In Netlify**: Site settings → Build & deploy → Repository
3. **Click "Link to a different repository"**
4. **Select your GitHub repo**: `Ankit-Shekhar/Pithu-ChatBot`
5. **Set build settings**:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
